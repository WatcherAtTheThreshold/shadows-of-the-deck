## What is Deck-Building?

If you've never played a deck-building game before: you start with a small deck of basic cards, then gradually buy better cards to add to your deck. Think of it like upgrading your toolkit - you begin with simple tools and work your way up to powerful equipment.

Your deck represents your abilities in the dream world. Better cards = more options and power.

## Quick Start (TL;DR)

1. **Play Focus cards** 🎯 → get orbs (money)
2. **Buy better cards** from the market → stronger deck
3. **Play Move cards** 👣 → travel to collect fragments 💎
4. **Avoid the countdown** ⚡ → game ends when Cruxflare deck runs out
5. **Win:** Get all 7 fragments before time runs out

---

## Your Starting Situation

**Your Deck (10 cards):**
- 7× Focus +1 🎯 (gives 1 orb each)
- 3× Move +1 👣 (moves 1 space each)

**Your Resources:**
- 3 orbs to spend
- Hand of 5 cards
- Standing at position 0 on the map

**The Map:**
- 18 positions (0 through 17)
- 7 fragments scattered across positions 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17
- Some positions have encounters (random events)

---

## Understanding the Game Screen

### The HUD (Top Bar)
- **🎯 Orbs:** Your currency for buying cards
- **💎 Fragments:** How many you've collected (need 7 to win)
- **⚡ Cruxflare:** Countdown timer (starts at 19, you lose at 0)

### Your Hand (Bottom)
Cards you can currently play. Click any card to use it immediately.

### The Market (Middle)
5 cards available for purchase using your orbs. Better cards cost more but do more.

### The Dream Map
- **Cyan dot:** Your position
- **💎 Golden dots:** Fragment locations
- **💫 Purple dots:** Encounter zones (random events)

---

## How Each Turn Works

### 1. Play Your Cards
- **Focus cards** 🎯: Give you orbs to spend
- **Move cards** 👣: Advance you on the map
- **Special cards**: Various powerful effects

**Strategy tip:** Usually play all your Focus cards first to see how many orbs you have, then decide on movement.

### 2. Buy from Market (Optional)
- Spend orbs on new cards
- Purchased cards go to your discard pile
- They'll be available in future hands when your deck reshuffles

**Strategy tip:** Early game, prioritize better Focus cards to generate more orbs later.

### 3. End Turn
- Any remaining cards in hand are discarded
- Draw 5 new cards for next turn
- **Cruxflare event happens** (usually bad for you)

---

## Key Concepts for New Players

### Deck Cycling
- Your deck starts with 10 cards
- When you run out of cards to draw, your discard pile becomes your new deck
- This means cards you buy will eventually come back to your hand

### The Cruxflare Threat
The purple counter in your HUD shows how many "bad events" are left. Each turn, one happens:
- Dead cards added to your deck (clutter)
- Market cards removed
- Map nodes collapsed
- Other nasty effects

**Important:** This is your real enemy, not just a timer!

### Encounters vs Safe Movement
- **Regular Move cards** 👣: Trigger encounters on purple nodes (risk/reward)
- **Safe Move cards** 🌀: Skip encounters entirely (more expensive but safer)

---

## Your First Few Turns (Walkthrough)

### Turn 1
1. **Play all Focus cards** in your hand (likely 2-3 cards) → gain 2-3 orbs
2. **Look at the market** - with ~5 total orbs, you can afford:
   - Focus +2 (3 orbs) - gives you better orb generation
   - Move +1 (2 orbs) - more movement options
3. **Consider movement** - you probably have 1-2 Move cards
4. **Recommendation:** Buy Focus +2 to improve your economy, save movement for turn 2

### Turn 2
1. **Play Focus cards** → should have more orbs now
2. **Start moving** toward the nearest fragment (position 2)
3. **Buy more cards** based on your strategy

### Turn 3+
- Balance buying power cards vs making progress on the map
- Watch the Cruxflare counter - don't wait too long to start collecting fragments!

## Strategy Tips

### Early Game (Turns 1-6)
- **Focus on economy:** Buy better Focus cards
- **Don't rush movement:** Build your deck first
- **Avoid expensive cards:** Stick to 2-4 orb purchases

### Mid Game (Turns 7-12)
- **Start collecting fragments:** Move toward positions 2, 5, 7
- **Buy defensive cards:** Shadow Blockers become important
- **Consider safe movement:** Encounters can slow you down

### Late Game (Turns 13+)
- **Fragment rush:** Use efficient movement and Fragment 2pts cards
- **Defensive focus:** Block Cruxflare effects when possible
- **Calculate carefully:** Make sure you can reach all remaining fragments

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I have to use all my cards each turn?**

A: Around turn 3-5, once you have better orb generation.

**Q: What if I land on an encounter?**  
A: You'll either gain 2-4 orbs (60% chance) or lose 1-2 orbs (40% chance). It's usually worth the risk early game.

**Q: Can I win without buying expensive cards?**  
A: Possible but harder. Better cards give you more options and efficiency.

**Q: What happens if the Cruxflare deck runs out?**
