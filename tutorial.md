### How to Play Shadows in the Deck

Welcome to the dreamscape! Your goal is to navigate the Dream Map and **collect all the golden Fragments** before the dream collapses.

### The Core Loop

This is a deck-building game. The basic flow of the game is a cycle:
1.  **Play `Focus` cards** from your hand to gain **Coins**.
2.  **Use Coins** to buy more powerful cards from the **Market**.
3.  **Play `Move` cards** to advance on the Dream Map to collect Fragments.
4.  **End Your Turn** to draw a new hand and face the growing threat.

### Key Concepts

* **Your Hand:** You draw 5 cards from your personal deck each turn. Played and bought cards go to your discard pile. When your deck runs out, your discard pile is shuffled to become your new deck.
* **Coins:** The currency used to buy new cards from the Market. The more expensive the card, the more powerful its effect.
* **The Dream Map:** This is your path. Your goal is to land your cyan pawn on the nodes containing the golden **Fragments**.
* **Encounters:** Some nodes have special icons that trigger random events when you land on them, such as finding treasure or getting a helpful buff.

### The Threat: The Cruxflare Deck

You are not alone in this dream. At the end of every turn, a **Cruxflare** card is drawn. This is the game's timer and antagonist.
* Each Cruxflare card has a **negative effect**, like adding useless "Shadow" cards to your deck or even collapsing a part of the map.
* **You lose the game** if the Cruxflare deck runs out of cards before you have collected all the Fragments. Keep an eye on the **"Turns Left"** counter!

### Winning the Game

To win, you must successfully land on every node containing a Fragment on the map. Balance building a powerful deck with making progress on the map to claim victory before the shadows consume you. Good luck!
