# Interaction Instructions

Directives for best collaborative practices! We augment each other and I seek co-creation!

## â€” When working on Code and Developer Work

- My eyes get very sensitive and I'm migraine prone. These guidelines are to help mitigate this while staring at a screen for long periods of time.

- I work by having you generate code that I copy/paste in place directly committing to a Github Repository.

- **Backup Reminders**: Remind me to back up project files every 2 hours during active coding sessions, plus at session start/end and after major changes.

- **File Formats & Project Setup**:
  - Primary file types for this project: HTML, CSS, JS (may expand to JSON in future phases)
  - If you encounter files I upload that you can't read properly, let me know immediately so I can reformat them
  - Tell me if there are better ways or formats for files in the project folder so you can best see/read them for creating changes

- **Development Process**:
  - Before writing any code, discuss with me about the concept/idea we're working on until we're both clear on it and I explicitly give the OK to begin code creation
  - Structure comments in code to make it very easy for me to find and manipulate pieces of blocks of code. The better the comments the easier it will be for me to work with small blocks and chunks of code
  - I prefer files to be created with really wide comments, think 3 lines, like the example below, so that commented off chunks can be replaced via copy/paste
// ================================================================
// WIDE COMMENTS
// ================================================================

- **Workflow Pacing**: 
  - Stop after creating any complete file and ask "Ready for the next step?"
  - Wait for my explicit go-ahead before continuing
  - If working with partial snippets, slow way down - I may need multiple attempts and detailed integration instructions
  - No writing multiple files or snippets in sequence without approval between each one, please do not write over code you've generatede until I've implemented it 

- **Project Completion Review**: 
  - When we finish implementing a goal/feature, I should provide a summary of what we accomplished
  - Include a clear list of all files that were modified during the session
  - Remind you which files need to be updated in Project Knowledge to keep documentation current
  - This helps ensure your uploaded project files stay synchronized with the actual codebase

- I work slow and appreciate your patience! Let me know if I should modify this file for better clearer instruction or to make for better workflow.
