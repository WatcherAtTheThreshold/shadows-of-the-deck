# 🛠️ Core Loop Polish Checklist – Shadows of the Deck

This checklist is for refining the current one-level build before scaling into a multi-level campaign.  
Goal: ensure the core loop is balanced, fun, and replayable so later levels inherit a solid template.

---

## 1. 🎴 Deck & Market Balance
- [ ] **Starting Deck feels balanced** – Player has early options for movement, economy, and defense.
- [ ] **No “auto-buy” cards** – Every market card has pros/cons; no single card dominates strategy.
- [ ] **No “dead” cards** – Each card type is worth considering in at least some situations.
- [ ] **Movement density feels right** – Player can move but not skip large sections too easily.
- [ ] **Variety in effects** – Enough unique effects to support different playstyles (movement combos, resource engines, defensive builds).

---

## 2. 🗺️ Map Flow & Length
- [ ] **Game length feels right** – Neither too short (ends abruptly) nor too long (drags mid-game).
- [ ] **Fragment placement creates tension** – Player must make choices on how to reach them.
- [ ] **Encounters break monotony** – Encounter rate keeps pacing lively without overwhelming.
- [ ] **Branching paths feel meaningful** *(if present)* – Choices matter; no “fake” forks.

---

## 3. 🌩️ Cruxflare Threat
- [ ] **Pacing of events feels fair** – Early turns allow deck building, later turns raise pressure.
- [ ] **Danger escalation is noticeable** – UI, music, or visual cues signal increased stakes.
- [ ] **Event variety forces adaptation** – Map shrink, market disruption, and hand interference all play a role.
- [ ] **Counterplay exists** – Defensive cards (e.g., Shadow Blocker) are useful but not overpowered.

---

## 4. 🔄 Turn Structure & Flow
- [ ] **No dead turns** – Player always has something useful to do.
- [ ] **Decision points feel meaningful** – Choices matter in resource spending, card play, and movement.
- [ ] **Turn length is snappy** – No unnecessary delays or slow animations between actions.
- [ ] **UI communicates state clearly** – Player always knows their resources, position, and threats.

---

## 5. 🏆 Win/Loss Balance
- [ ] **Win rate feels fair** – Around 40–60% for an experienced player; losses feel earned.
- [ ] **Losses teach something** – Players see what they could have done differently.
- [ ] **Comebacks are possible** – A bad start isn’t always fatal; smart play can recover.
- [ ] **Victory feels satisfying** – Endgame tension builds into a meaningful win moment.

---

## 6. 🎨 Feel & Replayability
- [ ] **The “fun moment” happens each run** – There’s at least one satisfying combo or turn in every game.
- [ ] **Runs feel different enough** – Deck draws, market variety, and encounters change playstyle.
- [ ] **Player wants “one more run”** – Strong replay pull even without new content.
- [ ] **Audio/visual cues reinforce mood** – Music phases, card effects, and map visuals enhance immersion.

---

## 7. 📌 Ready to Scale When:
- [ ] Can play 3+ runs in a row without major balance complaints.
- [ ] Market, map, and Cruxflare all feel like they’re working in concert.
- [ ] No single mechanic dominates; multiple strategies are viable.
- [ ] Confident that changing numbers in a config file can adjust difficulty without rewriting code.
