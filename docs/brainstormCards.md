# 🌟 Shadows of the Deck – New Card Concepts (Brainstorm)

*(Out-of-the-box, expansion-ready ideas for future sets)*

---

## 🛒 Market Deck Additions

### **Temporal Manipulation**

* ⏳ **Hourglass Flip** – Cost: 5 – Reverse the last Cruxflare card’s effect (if possible)
* 🌀 **Loop Step** – Cost: 6 – Take the same turn twice in a row
* 🔄 **Echo Fragment** – Cost: 7 – Treat the last fragment collected as if collected again

### **Map Alteration**

* 🗺️ **Path Weaver** – Cost: 4 – Swap positions of two nodes on the map
* 🏞️ **Dream Bridge** – Cost: 5 – Create a temporary safe node in front of you for one turn
* 🌌 **Pocket Realm** – Cost: 8 – Skip ahead to any fragment node, but trigger an encounter instantly

### **Resource Alchemy**

* 🔥 **Orb Burn** – Cost: 3 – Destroy up to 3 orbs to remove a dead card from your deck
* 💎 **Fragment Forge** – Cost: 6 – Spend 5 orbs to create a 1-point fragment in place
* ♻️ **Transmute** – Cost: 4 – Turn any card in your hand into a random card from the market

### **Hybrid Power Plays**

* 🌠 **Comet Dash** – Cost: 5 – Move 4 spaces, but take the next Cruxflare event immediately
* 🪞 **Mirror Move** – Cost: 4 – Copy the effect of any other card played this turn
* ⚡ **Surge Step** – Cost: 6 – Gain 3 orbs, then move 3 spaces

## 🌩️ Cruxflare Deck Additions

### **Reality Distortions**

* 🪐 **Gravity Fold** – Move 3 spaces backward, skipping any encounters
* 💭 **Dream Shatter** – Lose all orbs above your starting amount
* 🧩 **Fragment Fade** – Remove the nearest fragment from the map (relocates later)

### **Persistent Nightmares**

* 🌫️ **Lingering Shadow** – For the next 3 turns, all card costs are +1 orb
* 🪱 **Deck Rot** – Add a dead card to your deck each time you buy a market card until the effect is removed (via special card or event)

### **Player Manipulation**

* 🌀 **Turn Inversion** – Next turn must be played entirely in reverse order (End → Start)
* 💔 **Sever Link** – Lose one random card from your deck permanently

---

## 💀 Dead Card Variants

*(Dead cards with slight twists to add subtle tension)*

* 💀 **Haunted Echo** – No effect, but when drawn, peek at the top card of the Cruxflare deck
* 💀 **Shadow Weight** – Reduces your movement total by 1 if in hand
* 💀 **Nightglass** – No effect, but can be spent instead of an orb once

---

## 🌀 Special Mechanics Concepts

* **Two-Sided Cards**: Cards that “flip” after use, revealing a different effect next time they’re drawn.
* **Corrupted Market Cards**: Strong effects at lower cost, but each comes with a built-in penalty (dead card added, orb loss, forced Cruxflare draw).
* **Dream Keys**: Rare cards that “unlock” special fragments, worth extra points if collected.
