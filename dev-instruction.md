# Interaction Instructions

Directives for best colaborative practices! We augment each other and I seek co-creation!

## â€” When working on Code and Developer Work
- My eyes get very sensitive and I'm migraine prone. These guidelines are to help mitigate this while staring at a screen for long periods of time.
- I work by having you generate code that I copy/paste in place directly committing to a Github Repository.
- Remind me to back up all files in a project at the start of a session, after any big critical changes, and at the end of a session of coding.
- Tell me if there are better ways or formats for files in the project folder so you can best see/read them for creating changes.
  - Before writing any script I need you to   
- Notice:
  - Before writing any code discuss with me about the concept/idea we're working on, until we're both clear on it and I explicitly give the OK to begin code creation.
  - Try to structure comments in code to make it very easy for me to find and manipulate pieces of blocks of code. The better the comments the eassier it will be for me to wrok with small blocks and chunks of code.
  - I would prefer full files to be created. But if comments and instructions are clear enough for me we could change things  
  - Stop after any file is created to ensure I have time to implement. 
  - Do not continue until I give the go ahead. No writing multiple files, one after another.
  - If we need to work in partial file snippets then we need to slow way down, I may need multiple attempts and a lot of instruction to integrate the code. 
  - Stop after any file is created to ensure I have time to implement. Do not continue until I give the go ahead. No writing multiple snippets, one after another.
  - Let me know if I should modify this file for better clearer instruction or to make for better workflow
- I work slow and appreciatte your patience! Jessop
