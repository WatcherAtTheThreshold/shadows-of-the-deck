## 🗺 The Dream Map
- **Cyan pawn** = you.
- **🟡 Fragment Nodes** = collect automatically when you land on them.
- **🟣 Encounter Nodes** = trigger random events (gain/lose orbs).
- **🟢 Safe Nodes** = nothing happens.

## 🌩 The Cruxflare
- Acts as the **game timer**.
- At the end of every turn, reveal 1 Cruxflare card:
  - Add dead 🪦 cards to your deck
  - Remove market cards
  - Collapse map nodes
- **Lose** if the Cruxflare deck runs out.

## 👣 First Turn Walkthrough

**1. Start Phase**  
- Draw 5 cards from your starting deck.  
- Look for 🎯 **Focus** cards and 👣 **Move** cards.

**2. Action Phase**  
- Play all your 🎯 **Focus** cards to gain Orbs.  
  Example: 3× Focus +1 → 3 Orbs.  
- If you have 👣 **Move** cards, decide whether to move toward a Fragment now or save movement for next turn.

**3. Market Phase**  
- Spend your Orbs on cards from the Market.  
  Tip: Early on, buying stronger 🎯 cards increases buying power later.  
- Purchased cards go to your discard pile.

**4. End Phase**  
- Draw the top Cruxflare card and resolve its effect.  
  *(If you have a 🛡️ Shadow Blocker, it can negate this.)*  
- Discard your remaining cards and draw a new hand of 5.

## 💡 Quick Tips
- **Early Game:** Build orb generation to afford strong cards.
- **Mid Game:** Balance market buys with forward progress on the map.
- **Late Game:** Use safe movement 🌀 or blockers 🛡️ to counter big threats.
